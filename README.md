# treed
Treed was/is an experiment on how i could make social media less addictive.
It sort of succeeded, but I also ran into some limitations of the Mastodon API that didn't really make this viable long term.

At this point i no longer remember what the limitation was exactly, though.
It's been 2 years - maybe it's been fixed? Maybe it hasn't.

https://tilde.town/~dzwdz/blog/feeds.html is probably a good explanation of the reasoning behind all this.

I'd love it if someone picked this project up, I think the core idea has merit.
That being said, for now it's dead.

It still seems to work, though!
